# React / Redux goals
## React fundamentals
### Intro to React:

-   What is React? History & Goals
-   Components
-   JSX & Babel
-   Properties & Default Properties
-   Styling React
-   Conditionals in React

### React: JSX and Props
-   Better understand how to layout React applications
-   Use conditionals and loops in JSX

### React: Modules and CRA
-   Understand what Create React App is and how to use it
-   Use ES2015 modules to share code across files
-   Compare default vs. non-default exports
-   Using assets (images and CSS) in components

### Events and React State
-   Attach event handlers to components in React
-   Define React state
-   Initialize and change state with useState
-   Write event handlers to change component state   

### React Testing
-   Describe what react-testing-library is and how it works
-   Write smoke tests
-   Write snapshot tests
-   Write tests to mimic user interaction with our applications

### React State Patterns
-   Pass event handlers down as props to child components
-   Understand the key prop that React asks for when mapping over data
-   Use the callback pattern for useState to ensure state changes happen as expected
-   Learn about storing mutable items in state & updating them

### React Component Design
-   Learn tips for deciding on components & state
-   Practice designing a React app!
-   Compare different patterns for writing components
### React Forms
-   Build forms with React
-   Understand what controlled components are

### React Effects and Refs
-   Describe what the useEffect hook does
-   Use effects to run code after the rendering phase of a component
-   Describe what the useRef hook does
-   Use refs to access DOM nodes and work with timers

### Custom Hooks
-   Understand when it’s best to create custom hooks
-   Create a few helpful custom hooks

## React Router (V5)
There have been many changes between v5 and v6. Best approach here probably is  to just read the docs of React Router to identify basic topics to master.
### Patterns in React Router
-   Describe how router URL parameters work
-   Understand Switch and when to use/not use it
-   Compare different ways to redirect in React Router
-   Learn how to test React Router components

### History of React
-   Explore the history of React’s evolution
-   Build class-base components
-   Define the component lifecycle for class components
-   Describe the problems that hooks were created to solve
-   Get even more excited about hooks!
### React Context
-   Explain what context is
-   Use the Context API to provide and consume context

## Redux
### Redux Introduction
-   Describe what Redux is and how it can be useful
-   Define key redux terminology
   -   store
   -   reducer
   -   action
   -   dispatch
-   Define a pure function, and see examples of pure and impure functions
-   Include Redux in an application

### React Redux
-   Combine a Redux store with a React app
-   Pass state from the store to a component with useSelector
-   Dispatch actions to the store with useDispatch
### React-Redux Part 2
-   Avoid unnecessary re-rendering with useSelector
-   Include action types to avoid duplication
-   Include action creators to reduce code
-   Include React-Router with Redux

### Redux Thunk
-   Understand what ordinary actions & action creators can/cannot do
-   Introduce “thunk” middleware as method to have more powerful actions
-   Dispatch actions asynchronously
